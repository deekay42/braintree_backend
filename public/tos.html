                    <h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
                    <p>Copied and modified from Wordpress</p>
                    <h2 id="terms-of-service-1">Terms of Service</h2>
                    <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of www.leaqueiq.gg, the League IQ Android App, the League IQ iPhone App, the League IQ Desktop app, as well as all content and League IQ products and services (for example, ecommerce services as outlined below in Section 7e) available at or though these websites (collectively, “Services”). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, <a href="https://leagueiq.gg/privacy/">League IQ’s Privacy Policy</a>), and procedures that may be published from time to time by League IQ (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades. Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.</p>
                    <h2 id="whos-who">1. Who’s Who</h2>
                    <p>Throughout these Terms, “you” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.</p>
                    <h2 id="your-account">2. Your Account</h2>
                    <p>Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>
                    <h2 id="fees-payment-and-renewal">3. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
                    <p><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee (collectively, “Paid Services”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.</p>
                    <p><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). Your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase an annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services inside the iPhone App or the Android App.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
                    <h2 id="general-representation-and-warranty">4. General Representation and Warranty</h2>
                    <p>You represent and warrant that your use of our Services:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Will be in strict accordance with these Terms;</li>
                    <li>Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations</li>
                    <li>Will not overburden League IQ’s systems, as determined by us in our sole discretion;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="specific-service-terms">7. Specific Service Terms</h2>
                    <p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> We reserve the right to display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> You agree not to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Modify, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise alter or seek to derive the trade secrets and other inherent intellectual property of League IQ; or</li>
                    <li>License, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, or otherwise commercially exploit or make League IQ available to any third party, other than your authorized users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="intellectual-property">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>The Agreement does not transfer from League IQ to you any League IQ or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with League IQ. League IQ, the League IQ logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with League IQ or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of League IQ or League IQ's licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any League IQ or third party trademarks.</p>
                    <h2 id="changes">6. Changes</h2>
                    <p>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of League IQ, or by the posting by League IQ of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>
                    <h2 id="termination">7. Termination</h2>
                    <p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or due to prolonged inactivity, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid. If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your League IQ account, you may simply discontinue using our Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms. All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
                    <h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranties">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                    <p>Our Services are provided “as is.” League IQ and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither League IQ, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</p>
                    <h2 id="jurisdiction-and-applicable-law.">9. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.</h2>
                    <p>Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>
                    <h2 id="arbitration-agreement">10. Arbitration Agreement</h2>
                    <p>Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
                    <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>In no event will League IQ, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to League IQ under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. League IQ shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
                    <h2 id="indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
                    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless League IQ, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.</p>

                    <p>You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and/or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and we reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.</p>
                    <h2 id="translation">14. Translation</h2>
                    <p>These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p>
                    <h2 id="miscellaneous">15. Miscellaneous</h2>
                    <p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between League IQ and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; League IQ may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
